Hi outlaw 

If you want just a common constant, you may 
add python module like properties.py: 
... 
FOO = 'bar' 
... 

and then at the place your handlers defined do 

from properties import FOO 

-------- 
but if you want, as Philip said, to pass some variable between 
requests, 
you have 2 options 
a) Pass it to user side with response from one handler, 
   and then get it from request inside another handler - 
   This may be achieved by: 
   a1) What Philip has proposed - hidden form field, but then you 
should use post() 
   a2) via cookies 
b)You may put the value into memcache, or datastore 
memcache is not reliable though, it may be suddenly cleaned up in 
hours or even minutes. 

you may NOT use global variables between requests at all (probably you 
are aware of this already) 
because request handlers may be located inside different App Engine 
instances, 
this is not scalable. 

Best regards,
